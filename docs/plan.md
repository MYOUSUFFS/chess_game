# Online Chess Game Implementation Plan

## Objective
Transform the existing local chess game into an online multiplayer experience with minimal server overhead and efficient real-time synchronization.

## Key Requirements
- Play online from game start to end or reset
- Mutual reset approval from both players
- Minimal server-side data storage for performance
- Preserve existing local gameplay functionality

## Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Server (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- **Room Management**: Create/join game rooms with unique IDs
- **Player Matching**: Automatic pairing or manual room codes
- **Move Relay**: Real-time move broadcasting between players
- **Connection Handling**: Graceful disconnect/reconnect management
- **State Synchronization**: Handle desync scenarios
- **Reset Coordination**: Both players must approve game reset

### Client-Side Integration
- **Online Mode Toggle**: Switch between local and online play
- **Room Management UI**: Create/join rooms, display room codes
- **Real-time Updates**: Send/receive moves via WebSocket
- **Connection Status**: Show online/offline/disconnected states
- **Opponent Info**: Display opponent name and status
- **Reset Approval**: UI for reset requests and confirmations

### Minimal Data Storage
- **In-memory Sessions**: No persistent database required
- **Session Cleanup**: Auto-remove inactive games after timeout
- **Basic Validation**: Server-side move verification for anti-cheat

## Implementation Files

### New Files to Create
1. **server.js** - WebSocket server implementation
2. **package.json** - Server dependencies (socket.io, express)

### Existing Files to Modify
1. **script.js** - Add WebSocket client integration
2. **index.html** - Add online mode UI elements
3. **style.css** - Style online interface components

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Server Foundation
1. Create WebSocket server with Socket.IO
2. Implement room creation and joining
3. Add player connection management
4. Set up move broadcasting system

### Phase 2: Client Integration
1. Add WebSocket client to existing ChessGame class
2. Create online mode toggle functionality
3. Implement room management UI
4. Add connection status indicators

### Phase 3: Game Synchronization
1. Implement move sending/receiving
2. Add opponent move validation
3. Handle turn synchronization
4. Implement disconnection recovery

### Phase 4: Reset System
1. Add reset request mechanism
2. Implement mutual approval system
3. Coordinate reset across both clients
4. Handle reset during disconnection

## Performance Optimizations
- Lightweight message protocol (only essential move data)
- Connection pooling and efficient WebSocket management
- Automatic cleanup of inactive games
- Reconnection with game state restoration
- Minimal server-side processing

## Data Flow

### Game Start
1. Player creates room -> Server generates room ID
2. Player shares room ID -> Opponent joins room
3. Server pairs players -> Game begins with synchronized state

### Move Synchronization
1. Player makes move -> Client validates move locally
2. Move sent to server -> Server broadcasts to opponent
3. Opponent receives move -> Client updates board state
4. Turn switches -> UI updates for both players

### Reset Process
1. Player requests reset -> Server notifies opponent
2. Opponent approves/denies -> Server coordinates response
3. Both approve -> Game state resets for both players
4. Game continues with fresh state

This plan maintains all existing functionality while adding robust online multiplayer capabilities with efficient resource usage and smooth user experience.
